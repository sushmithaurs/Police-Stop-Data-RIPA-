# Police Stop Data (RIPA) – Exploratory Data Analysis & Tableau Dashboard

This project focuses on **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** of police stop records collected under the **Racial and Identity Profiling Act (RIPA)**. The goal is to analyze patterns in police stop outcomes, search rates, and contraband discovery across racial groups using data-driven methods and visual analytics.

Interactive dashboards were developed using **Tableau** to clearly communicate trends, proportions, and disparities in policing practices.
